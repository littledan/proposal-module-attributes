# Mismatch between Content-Type and file extension on the web

For Node.js or tooling we can make the association between the type of a file and its extension.
For example, it might sound obvious that a file ending with `.js` would correspond to a `application/javascript` file.

Interestingly, Node.js or webpack does allow to arbitrarily redirect module resolution.
Our previous assumption is already not guaranteed. See [#4](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/4).

Moreover, on the web the server needs to send a `Content-Type` header to the client, so that
the client can know how to interpret the ressource being transfered.

The web server could be misconfigured (or malicious) and send a wrong `Content-Type` header to the client. For example,
a file with the extension `.css` could end up being a JavaScript file and be evaluated by the client.

This proposal will allow the developer to assert that their ressources will be interpreted correctly.

## Analysis

This analysis demonstrates that on internet (as seen by Cloudflare at least) the
file extension may not be served with its corresponding mimetype.

Considering Cloudflare's scale, even a very small percentage can reprensent a
lot of requests.
