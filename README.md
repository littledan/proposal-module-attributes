Status: Stage 1

## Synopsis

The ES Module Attributes proposal is an investigation into providing inline syntax for module import statements to pass on more information alongside the module specifier, with an initial aim to support non-JS ESM module types.

## Motivation

As one example of an application: standards-track JSON ESM modules were [proposed](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/770) to allow JavaScript modules to easily import JSON data files, similarly to how they are supported in many nonstandard JavaScript module systems. This idea quickly got broad support from web developers and browsers, and was merged into HTML, with an implementation created by Microsoft.

However, in [an issue](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/839), Ryosuke Niwa (Apple) and Anne van Kesteren (Mozilla) proposed that security would be improved if some syntactic marker were required when importing JSON modules and similar module types which cannot execute code, to prevent a scenario where the responding server unexpectedly provides a different MIME type, causing code to be unexpectedly executed. The solution was to somehow indicate that a module was JSON, or in general, not to be executed, somewhere in addition to the MIME type.

Some developers have the intuition that the file extension could be used to determine the module type, as it is in many existing non-standard module systems. However, it's a deep web architectural principle that the suffix of the URL (which you might think of as the "file extension" outside of the web) does not lead to semantics of how the page is interpreted. In practice, on the web, there is a widespread [mismatch between file extension and the HTTP Content Type header](content-type-vs-file-extension.md). All of this sums up to it being infeasible to depend on file extensions/suffixes included in the module specifier to be the basis for this checking.

There are other possible pieces of metadata which could be associated with modules, see [#8](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes/issues/8) for further discussion.

Proposed ES module types that are blocked by this security concern, in addition to JSON modules, include [CSS modules](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/4898) and potentially [HTML modules](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/4505) if the HTML module  proposal is restricted to [not allow script](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/805).

## Rationale

There are three places where this data could be provided:
- As part of the module specifier (e.g., as a pseudo-scheme)
  - Challenges: Adds complexity to URLs or other module specifier syntaxes, and risks being confusing to developers (further discussion: [#11](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/11))
- Separately, out of band (e.g., a separate resource file)
  - Challenges: How to load that resource file; what should the format be; unergonomic to have to jump between files during development (further discussion: [#13](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/13))
- In the JavaScript source text
  - Challenges: Requires a change at the JavaScript language level (this proposal)

This proposal pursues the third option, as we expect it to lead to the best developer experience, and are hopeful that language design/standardization issues can be resolved.

## Early draft syntax

Module attributes have to be made available in several different contexts. This section contains one possible syntax, but there are other options, discussed in [#6](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/6).

Here, a single string is permitted to describe a single module attribute, as discussed in [#12](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/12).

Although unspecified in the module attributes proposal, this intention of the proposal champions is that this string would be interpreted as the module type, as shown in the following examples.

The JavaScript standard would basically be responsible for passing the string up to the host environment, which could then decide how to interpret it. Issues [#24](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/24) and [#25](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/25) discuss the Web and Node.js feature and semantic requirements respectively, and issue [#10](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/10) discusses how to allow different JavaScript environments to have interoperability.

### import statements

The ImportDeclaration would allow a string provided at the end of an import statement with the `as` keyword.

```js
import json from "./foo.json" as "json";
```

The host environment would determine the interpretation of `"json"`. In the Web and similar environments, `as "json"` would be required to load JSON modules, whereas no `as` syntax would be used for JavaScript modules.

### dynamic import()

The `import()` pseudo-function would allow the string as its second argument.

```js
import("foo.json", "json")
```

### Integration of modules into environments

Host environments (e.g., the Web platform, Node.js) often provide various different ways of loading modules. The analogous string could be passed through these ways of loading other kinds of modules.

#### Worker instantiation

```js
new Worker("foo.wasm", { as: "webassembly" });
```

Sidebar about WebAssembly module types and the web: it's still uncertain whether importing WebAssembly modules would need to be marked specially, or would be imported just like JavaScript. Further discussion in [#19](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues/19).

#### HTML

```html
<script src="foo.wasm" type="webassembly"></script>
```

(See the caveat about WebAssembly above.)

#### WebAssembly

In the context of the [WebAssembly/ESM integration proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/esm-integration): For imports of other module types from within a WebAssembly module, this proposal would introduce a new custom section (named `importattributes`) that will annotate with attributes each imported module (which is listed in the import section).

## Status and plan for standardization

This proposal is at Stage 1.

Standardization here would consist of building consensus not just in TC39 but also in WHATWG HTML as well as the Node.js ESM effort and a general audit of semantic requirements across various host environments ([#10](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes/issues/10), [#24](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes/issues/24) and [#25](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes/issues/25)).

Please leave any feedback you have in the [issues](http://github.com/littledan/proposal-module-attributes/issues)!

### Generalized constant form (richer `as` values)

We can extend the concept of the `as` syntax by generalizing the right hand side value. A constant value, an array or an object containing only constant values. For example:

```js
import value from "module" as {key1: "value1", key2: [1, 2, 3]};
```

This would allow module attributes to scale to support a variety of metadata. It is currently unclear if the generalized constant form will be pursued in this proposal or in a follow up. In either case the addition of the generalized constant form is not hard to design, specify and implement on top of the existing [spec text outline](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-module-attributes/). 

## FAQ

### Why not out of band?

Why not both? The champions of this proposal think that exploring both an in- and out of band solutions to this problem are desirable. Depending on the environment in which JavaScript is being executed in either approach could be seen as desirable.

While an in band solution is more verbose, it is also more straightforward for developers to adopt. For smaller projects developers do not need to create an extra file by hand. For large project with many dependencies developers will not have to worry about creating a large manifest by compiling the metadata of all of their dependencies. Module authors will also not have to worry about shipping a manifest in order for consumers to be able to run their modules.

### Are there cross-environment concerns?

Absolutely. This proposal is not attempting to standardize the specific `type`s a host will be allowed to support. It will be up to each host environment to decide which `type`s to support, as well as how to handle the the case of an unsupported module `type` being imported.

Module specifiers are an example of prior art for this type of decision making. It is left up to the host how to resolve a module specifier into a URL that will eventually be loaded.

Independent of the potential cross-environment concerns it is not a problem that is specific to an in band solution. An out of band solution would also suffer from the risk of inconsistent implementation or support across host environments.

The topic of attribute divergence is further discussed in  [#34](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-module-attributes/issues/34).

### Should the generalized constant form be supported in the first iteration?

This proposal was inspired by a single use case, to unblock other module types (JSON, CSS, HTML) from a security concern on environments like the Web where modules may be remotely loaded. It's unclear whether there is a sufficiently motivating use case to add the generalized constant form in the first iteration of the proposal. The generalized constant form adds some complexity, including in the surface area of cross-environment concerns.

The champion group is interested in investigating the generalized constant form, and considering it for inclusion in either this proposal or a follow-on, weighing the expressiveness against the costs listed above, in consultation with TC39.

### How would this proposal work with caching?

Currently in [the ECMA262 spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-hostresolveimportedmodule) passing the same module specifier and referrer there is guaranteed to get the same module. This proposal aims to have a similar guarantee; if a developer passes the same module specifier, referrer, and attributes there would be a guarantee of receiving the same module.

We expect that hosts will cache/coalesce further than this. For example, on the Web and similar environments, when providing a type module attribute, the module type would not form part of the cache key, where modules are always cached by the resolved URL. Instead, the type attribute is used simply for a check, which would cause the module graph to fail to load in the event of a mismatch
